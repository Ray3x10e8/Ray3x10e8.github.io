      <div id="paper1" class="paper-abstract">
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> In this work we study quantum position verification with continuous-variable quantum states. In contrast to existing discrete protocols, we present and analyze a protocol that utilizes coherent states and its properties. Compared to discrete-variable photonic states, coherent states offer practical advantages since they can be efficiently prepared and manipulated with current technology. We prove security of the protocol against any unentangled attackers via entropic uncertainty relations, showing that the adversary has more uncertainty than the honest prover about the correct response as long as the noise in the quantum channel is below a certain threshold. Additionally, we show that attackers who pre-share one continuous-variable EPR pair can break the protocol. </p>

      <div id="paper2" class="paper-abstract">
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> Motivated by the fact that coherent states may offer practical advantages it was recently shown that a continuous-variable (CV) quantum position verification (QPV) protocol using coherent states could be securely implemented if and only if attackers do not pre-share any entanglement. In the discrete-variable (DV) analogue of that protocol it was shown that modifying how the classical input information is sent from the verifiers to the prover leads to a favourable scaling in the resource requirements for a quantum attack. In this work, we show that similar conclusions can be drawn for CV-QPV. By adding extra classical information of size n to a CV-QPV protocol, we show that the protocol, which uses a coherent state and classical information, remains secure, even if the quantum information travels arbitrarily slow, against attackers who pre-share CV (entangled) states with a linear (in n) cutoff at the photon number. We show that the protocol remains secure for certain attenuation and excess noise.</p>

      <div id="paper3" class="paper-abstract">
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CVQKD) at large distances has such high noise levels that the error-correcting code must have very low rate. In this regime it becomes feasible to implement random-codebook error correction, which is known to perform close to capacity. We propose a reverse reconciliation scheme for CVQKD in which the first step is advantage distillation based on random-codebook error correction operated above the Shannon limit. Our scheme has a novel way of achieving statistical decoupling between the public reconciliation data and the secret key. We provide an analysis of the secret key rate for the case of Gaussian collective attacks, and we present numerical results. The best performance is obtained when the message size exceeds the mutual information I(X;Y) between Alice's quadratures X and Bob's measurements Y, i.e. the Shannon limit. This somewhat counter-intuitive result is understood from a tradeoff between code rate and frame rejection rate, combined with the fact that error correction for QKD needs to reconcile only random data. We obtain secret key rates that lie far above the Devetak-Winter value I(X;Y)−I(E;Y), which is the upper bound in the case of one-way error correction. Furthermore, our key rates lie above the PLOB bound for Continuous-Variable detection, but below the PLOB bound for Discrete-Variable detection. </p>

                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    The advent of Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has significantly transformed communication technologies, offering substantial benefits across various domains. However, these advancements have also introduced profound challenges, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. This seminar critically examines the role of Generative AI in enabling the creation of highly sophisticated and targeted phishing emails. It investigates the strategies that malicious actors may employ to exploit these advanced models, including techniques to bypass the ethical and technical safeguards implemented by developers. By shedding light on the evolving tactics of AI-driven phishing attacks, this session aims to enhance the understanding of the emerging threats posed by Generative AI and contribute to the broader discourse on its implications for the cybersecurity landscape.

                    On the communication complexity of finding tournament winners
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    A tournament is a complete directed graph. A king in a tournament is a vertex v such that every other vertex is reachable from v via a path of length at most 2. It is well known that every tournament has at least one king, one of which is a maximum out-degree vertex. We study the communication complexity of these tasks in the most natural two-party distributed setting, where the edges of an underlying tournament are partitioned between two players. I will talk about some of our recent results for n-vertex tournaments:

1) The deterministic communication complexity of finding whether a source exists is ~Theta(log^2 n).
2) The deterministic and randomized communication complexities of finding a king are Theta(n).
3) The deterministic, randomized and quantum communication complexities of finding a maximum out-degree vertex are Theta(n log n), Theta(n log log n) and ~Theta(sqrt{n}), respectively.
Our upper bounds hold for all partitions of edges, and the lower bounds for a specific partition of the edges.

I will try to present ideas of proofs of some of our upper bounds and sketch the ideas that go into the lower bounds. This is based on joint work with Manaswi Paraashar, Swagato Sanyal and Nitin Saurabh.

                    A Security Alert Investigation Tool Supporting Tier 1 Analysts in Contextualizing and Understanding Network Security Events
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    The investigations run by tier 1 (T1) analysts in a Security Operation Center are critical to the SOC operations as they represent the first gateway to alert escalation and incident response. Critically, they demand an accurate and as-complete-as-possible
 understanding of the events surrounding the investigated alert. This is a complex task inexperienced T1 analysts can easily lose track of. In this presentation, we introduce an alert investigation support tool to help inexperienced analysts identify and collect
 all the information relevant to the investigation of an alert. We evaluate the prototype tool with two qualitative studies. The first study employs T1 analysts from the SOC to evaluate the conformity of the tool to the underpinning analysis process. The second
 study employs 57 students, recruited from the same pool where the SOC acquires its junior analysts from, to evaluate whether it helps inexperienced analysts develop a complete understanding of events surrounding security alert data. Our findings suggest that
 employing the tool helps inexperienced analysts form a more accurate understanding of attacks, at no time cost.

                    Attacking Operational Technology Without Specialized Knowledge:  The Unspecialized OT Threat Actor Profile
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Due to the unique characteristics of Operational Technology (OT), i.e., technology centered around cyber-physical activities, performing OT-related cyber-attacks is traditionally thought to require both specialized- and generic IT-related knowledge. However, in recent years, the need for specialized knowledge decreased, and OT-related cyber-attacks became increasingly easier to perform.

During this presentation, I profile a new threat actor, who performs targeted, OT-related cyber-attacks with at most basic generic knowledge. I show the relevance of this threat actor by identifying past OT-related cyber-attacks that match this threat actor profile’s capabilities; I do so by mapping the types of tools used during these cyber-attacks and the knowledge required to use them.

To further substantiate this analysis, I present the results of an investigation on readily-available tools that can assist threat actors in performing OT-related cyber-attacks today. The combination of findings highlights the present-day lowered entry level requirements to attack OT environments while limiting the scope of current assumptions, and highlights important, but less explored, directions of OT-related cybersecurity research.

                    Obfuscation of Programmable Logic Controllers 
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    In Industrial Control Systems (ICSs), critical components like Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) could be exploited by potential attackers aiming to manipulate industrial functionalities. However, executing sophisticated cyber-physical attacks requires a deep understanding of the underlying physical process at the core of the target ICS. In the talk, we explore the possibility of using code obfuscation to hamper system reconnaissance and thus protect ICSs from targeted attacks. In particular, we propose obfuscation strategies for PLC memories involving memory registers, PLC code, and simulated physical processes controlled by the obfuscated PLCs. We evaluate the degree of complexity added by obfuscation in terms of potency, resilience, and cost. We discuss the application of the proposed obfuscation strategies through a non-trivial use case of a water treatment system and their evaluation.

                    Key Recovery Attacks on Approximate Homomorphic Encryption with Non-Worst-Case Noise Flooding Countermeasures
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    In this work, we present novel key-recovery attacks on Approximate Homomorphic Encryption schemes, such as CKKS, when employing noise-flooding countermeasures based on non-worst-case noise estimation. Our attacks build upon and enhance the seminal work by Li and Miccincio at EUROCRYPT 2021. We demonstrate that relying on average-case noise estimation undermines noise-flooding countermeasures, even if the secure noise bounds derived from differential privacy as published by Li et al. at CRYPTO 2022 are implemented. This study emphasizes the necessity of adopting worst-case noise estimation in Approximate Homomorphic Encryption when sharing decryption results. We perform the proposed attacks on openFHE, an emerging open-source FHE library garnering increased attention. We experimentally demonstrate the ability to recover the secret key using just one shared decryption output. Furthermore, we investigate the implications of our findings for other libraries, such as IBM's HElib library, which allow experimental estimation of the noise bounds. Finally, we reveal that deterministic noise generation utilizing a pseudorandom generator fails to provide supplementary protection.

                    Secure Graph Algorithms and Oblivious Data Structures for Multiparty Computation
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Secure multiparty computation (MPC) is a field in cryptography in which the goal is to develop protocols such that several parties, each with their own private input, can jointly run the protocol without revealing their input. Only information on the input that can be logically deduced from the output may leak. In this thesis, we study graph algorithms and data structures for MPC. A motivating application of graph algorithms is fraud detection in the banking sector. We can convert transaction networks to graphs and perform computations on them, but as we work with privacy-sensitive data it is important to perform these computations securely. By studying three graph theoretical problems, the celebrity problem, cycle detection, and shortest path problem, our goal is to develop various techniques that can be used for graph algorithms for MPC. Next to that, we also take a look at Oblivious RAM (ORAM). ORAM will be used to implement graph algorithms as well as to construct oblivious data structures for MPC. We present an oblivious stack, queue, binary search tree, and priority queue. This is of interest as data structures are closely related to the performance of algorithms.

                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Third-Party Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Services, a.k.a. Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS), are an increasingly adopted business model, which enables possibly unskilled users, with no background knowledge, to operate drones and run automated drone-based tasks. Although these services provide significant advantages, the resources provided by drones are typically owned by multiple parties. Thus, Third-Party UAV services require adopting multi-party access control solutions. In this context, the leakage of the access control policies specified by the data owners might disclose confidential information and, thus, they should be protected as well. In this talk, we will present a solution that advances an existing privacy-preserving multi-party access control framework based on Secure Function Evaluation to fit the distributed and heterogeneous nature of drone deployments.

                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Kyber is a key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) that has been selected to be part of NIST’s first post-quantum cryptography standard. It’s security is based on the hardness of a variant of the learning with errors (LWE) problem. Jasmin is a low level programming language designed to implement cryptographic primitives, and correction and security properties of Jasmin programs can be proven using the proof assistant EasyCrypt. A formally verified implementation of Kyber called Hakyber has been developed, written in Jasmin, and formally verified in EasyCrypt. Hakyber’s correction proof involves more complex mathematical structures than the cryptographic primitives that were previously formalized In EasyCrypt. In this talk we will discuss the correction proof of Hakyber, in particular the correction proof of the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) that Hakyber uses. We will go over the structure of the proof, the difficulties encountered, and the modifications to EasyCrypt that we are currently developing to avoid these issues in future work, namely type classes and annotations.

                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Storing data on an external server with information-theoretic security, while using a key shorter than the data itself, is impossible. As an alternative, we propose a scheme that achieves information-theoretically secure evidence of accessing: The server is able to obtain information about the stored data, but not while staying undetected. Moreover, the client only needs to remember a key whose length is much shorter than the data. We provide a security proof for our scheme, based on an entropic uncertainty relation, similar to QKD proofs. Our scheme works if Alice is able to (reversibly) randomise the message to almost-uniformity with only a short key. By constructing an explicit attack we show that the desired security properties cannot be achieved without this randomisability.

                    Leveraging Partial Model Extractions using Uncertainty Quantification
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Companies have started to offer paid access to machine learning models as a service (MLaaS). The creation of said models requires the gathering curating and labeling of large amounts of data, which is a costly and time-consuming process. Providing black box access to the model unfortunately leaves one open to cloning attacks. With sufficiently many queries spend to the service it is possible to create a surrogate dataset and extract a clone of the underlying ML model, subverting the business model. We present a new cloning scheme that uses uncertainty quantification (UQ) to get arbitrarily close to the accuracy of the service for any amount of queries spend at the cost of needing to delegate a fraction of inputs to the service. In this two-step scheme the adversary first creates a "partial" clone using a conventional cloning attack with a small number of queries. Next, during inference the adversary uses UQ to decide whether the output of the partial clone is likely in line with that of the service. If not, it will delegate the input to the service and substitute its own output with that of the service. This way an adversary can set up their own competing service leeching from the original. Using this scheme, the overall costs made in terms of queries can be minimized given an expected number of sales such that the adversary can turn a profit. Compared to previous attacks the new scheme allows for significant lower initial costs, ensures an accuracy arbitrarily close to that of the targeted service, and can result in overall lower costs.

                    The return of Eratosthenes: Secure Generation of RSA Moduli using Distributed Sieving
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Secure multiparty generation of an RSA biprime is a challenging task, which increasingly receives attention, due to the numerous privacy-preserving applications that require it. In this work, we construct a new protocol for the RSA biprime generation task, secure against a malicious adversary, who can corrupt any subset of protocol participants. Our protocol is designed for generic MPC, making it both platform-independent and allowing for weaker security models to be assumed (e.g., honest majority), should the application scenario require it. By carefully ``postponing" the check of possible inconsistencies in the shares provided by malicious adversaries, we achieve noteworthy efficiency improvements. Concretely, we are able to produce additive sharings of the prime candidates, from multiplicative sharings via a semi-honest multiplication, without degrading the overall (active) security of our protocol. This is the core of our sieving technique, increasing the probability of our protocol sampling a biprime. Similarly, we perform the first biprimality test, requiring several repetitions, without checking input share consistency, and perform the more costly consistency check only in case of success of the Jacobi symbol based biprimality test. Moreover, we propose a protocol to convert an additive sharing over a ring, into an additive sharing over the integers. Besides being a necessary sub-protocol for the RSA biprime generation, this conversion protocol is of independent interest. The cost analysis of our protocol demonstrated that our approach improves the current state-of-the-art (Chen et al. -- Crypto 2020), in terms of communication efficiency. Concretely, for the two-party case with malicious security, and primes of 2048 bits, our protocol improves communication by a factor of ~37.

                    How to backdoor a cipher
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Newly designed block ciphers are required to show resistance against known attacks, e.g., linear and differential cryptanalysis. Two widely used methods to do this are to employ an automated search tool (e.g., MILP, SAT/SMT, etc.) and/or provide a wide-trail argument. In both cases, the core of the argument consists of bounding the transition probability of the statistical property over an isolated non-linear operation, then multiply it by the number of such operations (e.g., number of active S-boxes).
                    In this talk we show that in the case of linear cryptanalysis such strategies can sometimes lead to a gap between the claimed security and the actual one, and that this gap can be exploited by a malicious designer. We introduce Rood, a block cipher with a carefully crafted backdoor. By using the means of the wide-trail strategy, we argue the resistance of the cipher against linear and differential cryptanalysis. However, the cipher has a key-dependent iterative linear approximation over 12 rounds, holding with probability 1. This property is based on the linear hull effect although any linear trail underlying the linear hull has probability smaller than 1.

                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    In this paper we provide evidence of an emerging criminal infrastructure enabling impersonation attacks at scale. Impersonation-as-a-Service (ImpaaS) allows attackers to systematically collect and enforce user profiles (consisting of user credentials, cookies, device and behavioural fingerprints, and other metadata) to circumvent risk-based authentication system and effectively bypass multi-factor authentication mechanisms. We present the ImpaaS model and evaluate its implementation by analysing the operation of a large, invite-only, Russian ImpaaS platform providing user profiles for more than 260'000 Internet users worldwide. Our findings suggest that the ImpaaS model is growing, and provides the mechanisms needed to systematically evade authentication controls across multiple platforms, while providing attackers with a reliable, up-to-date, and semi-automated environment enabling target selection and user impersonation against Internet users as scale.

                    Privacy-preserving Multi-party Access Control
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Multi-party access control has been proposed to enable collaborative decision making for the protection of co-owned resources. In particular, multi-party access control aims to reconcile conflicts arising from the evaluation of policies authored by different stakeholders for jointly-managed resources, thus determining whether access to those resources should be granted or not. While providing effective solutions for the protection of co-owned resources, existing approaches do not address the protection of policies themselves, whose disclosure can leak sensitive information about, e.g., the relationships of co-owners with other parties. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving multi-party access control mechanism, which preserves the confidentiality of user policies. In particular, we propose secure computation protocols for the evaluation of multi-party policies, based on two privacy-preserving techniques, namely homomorphic encryption and secure function evaluation. An experimental evaluation of our approach shows its practical feasibility in terms of both computation and communication costs.

                    Phishing experiments with humans, or the effectiveness of tailored phishing techniques

                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Organizations worldwide are observing the appearance of more and more sophisticated attacks specifically targeting their employees and customers alike. These attacks exploit tailored information on the victim or organization to increase their credibility. To date, no study has evaluated the role of 'traditional' phishing cognitive effects in these advanced settings. In this paper, we run a phishing controlled experiment targeting 747 subjects employed in two organizations (a university and a large, international consultancy company) to evaluate the interaction between phishing persuasion techniques and success rate in a highly-tailored setting. For this purpose, we borrow from the user notification literature to devise enhanced attack delivery techniques, and evaluate how such techniques affect the success rate of our phishing campaigns. We find that the effect of 'traditional' attack techniques is widely mitigated in highly-tailored phishing settings, suggesting that current user training and detection techniques may be off-target for more sophisticated attacks.
                    However, we find that the means by which the attack is delivered to the victim matter, and can greatly (up to three times) boost the effect of the attack in its base form.

                    On Attribute Retrieval in ABAC
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Despite the growing interest in Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and the large amount of research devoted to the specification and evaluation of ABAC policies, to date only little work has addressed the issue of attribute management and retrieval. In modern systems, the attributes needed for policy evaluation are often retrieved from external sources (e.g., sensors, access points). This poses concerns on the correctness of policy evaluation as the policy decision point can be provided with incorrect attribute values, which can potentially yield incorrect decisions. In this talk, we present our investigation on the problem of selecting mechanisms for attribute retrieval and its relation with the accuracy of policy evaluation. We first introduce the notion of policy evaluation under error rate and use this notion to compute the evaluation accuracy of a policy. We formulate the Attribute Retrieval Mechanism Selection Problem (ARMSP) in terms of evaluation accuracy and show that ARMSP is exponential in the number of attribute values. To overcome this computation limitation, we investigate approaches to estimate the evaluation accuracy of a policy while maintaining the computation feasible.

                    Evaluation Framework for Network Intrusion Detection Systems for In-Vehicle CAN
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Abstract Modern vehicles are complex safety critical cyber physical systems, that are connected to the outside world, with all security implications it brings. Different network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) proposed for the CAN bus, the predominant type of in-vehicle network, to improve security are hard to compare due to disparate evaluation methods adopted.
                    In this paper we provide the means to compare CAN NIDSs on equal footing and evaluate the ones detailed in the literature. Based on this we observe some limitation of existing approaches and why in the CAN setting it is intrinsically difficult to distinguish benign from malicious payload. We argue that "meaning-aware" detection (a concept we define) which is challenging (but perhaps not impossible) to create for this setting.

                    The problem of path finding in supersingular isogeny graphs has recently been proposed as a hard problem underlying the post-quantum key exchange scheme SIKE. So far, both quantum and classical attacks have exponential time complexity. However, for a small subset of the vertices, the Spine, path-finding is much easier. For cryptanalysis, the Spine is typically assumed to be randomly distributed through the graph. We will look at many examples of isogeny graphs to show how the Spine sits inside the supersingular isogeny graph.

                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Modern vehicles are complex safety critical cyber physical systems, that are connected to the outside world, with all security implications that brings. To enhance vehicle security several network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) have been proposed for the CAN bus, the predominant type of in-vehicle network. <br>
                    The in-vehicle CAN bus, however, is a challenging place to do intrusion detection as
                    messages provide very little information; interpreting them requires specific knowledge about the implementation that is not readily available. In this paper we collect how existing solutions address this challenge by providing an organized inventory of frame based CAN NIDS proposed in literature, categorizing them based on what information they extract from the network and how they build their model.

                    Efficient Secure Ridge Regression from Randomized Gaussian Elimination
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    We present a practical protocol for secure ridge regression. We develop the necessary secure linear algebra tools, using only basic arithmetic over prime Fields. In particular, we show how to solve linear systems of equations and compute matrix inverses efficiently, using appropriate secure random self-reductions of these problems. The distinguishing feature of our approach is that the use of secure fixed-point arithmetic is avoided entirely, while circumventing the need for rational reconstruction at any stage as well. The effectiveness of our protocol is demonstrated by implementation in a standard setting for information-theoretically secure multiparty computation, tolerating a dishonest minority of passively corrupt parties. Using the MPyC framework, which is based on threshold secret sharing over finite fields, we show how to handle large datasets efficiently, achieving root-mean-square errors arbitrarily close to those of plaintext Scikit-learn. Moreover, we do not assume that any (part) of the datasets is held privately by any of the parties, which makes our protocol much more versatile than previous solutions which utilize assumptions on private held data. Our experiments show that our solution outperforms existing solutions for datasets commonly used for secure ridge regression benchmarking, reaching new heights running efficiently on larger real-world datasets than previous works.

                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    In a setting where an aggregator is interested in users' private data, but the users do not trust the aggregator, an often used solution is to have the users to mask their private data under random noise. That way the aggregator cannot be certain about any individual's private data, but as the random noise averages out they still obtain information about the user population as a whole. The aggregator and the users have competing requirements for the random noise protocol: the aggregator wants reliable information about population statistics (Utility) while the users want to protect their private data (Privacy). In this talk, we will look at commonly used definitions of Privacy and Security for random protocols, their shortcomings, and how new definitions based on information theory give us a better understanding of the functioning of such random protocols.

                    The security assessment was comprised of two critical parts, where the penetration tester impersonated both an external and an internal attacker. In the effort to assess the general security posture of these infrastructures, the penetration tester has conducted general intelligence gathering, comprehensive network scanning and enumeration, vulnerability assessment and confirmation by means of penetration, as well as pivoting within the infrastructure.
                    The purpose of this engagement was to assess the effectiveness of security measures put in place by Technical University of Eindhoven, further the client, in order to secure confidentiality and integrity of infrastructure's resources, as well as availability of specific systems.

                    Crypto plumbing: replay attacks and sequence numbers
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Network protocols have different strategies and threat models for
                    dealing with surveillance, censorship, and with other active tampering.
                    Many of the strategies rest on pre-masssurveillance assumptions that do
                    not hold with the adversaries that we know to be relevant. <br>
                    This talk focuses on a simple concept: sequence numbers and its
                    relation to replay attacks. Preventing replay attacks is usually
                    hand-waved away as a local issue or is ambiguously specified in a way
                    that leaves protocols open to information leakage. <br>
                    We will explore some of the different strategies while comparing and
                    contrasting across myriad of contemporary internet protocols.

                    Interactive Visualization of Event Logs for Cybersecurity
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Many domains nowadays try to gain insight in complex phenomena by logging their behavior. Telecom companies for instance analyze their communication networks for the presence of fraud, hospitals analyze patient treatments to discover bottlenecks in the process, and companies study their work flows to improve customer satisfaction. The common ground here is that domains are interested in the analysis of (anomalous) behavior in their system by recording events.  The definition of "anomalous" behavior unfortunately is often ill-defined. In addition, the number of events and data attributes in real-world data is typically in the order of thousands and more. <br>
                    In this presentation we will discuss the role of data visualization for the detection and explanation of anomalous system behavior.  We will show the application of visualization  techniques in the security domain, where we focus on the protection of critical infrastructures against complex virus attacks (a.k.a. Advanced Persistent Threats). The presented techniques however are general enough to be used in other domains.

                    Discovering Anomalous Frequent Patterns From Event Logs
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Organizations usually employ security policies to prevent data breaches and to guarantee the smooth execution of their processes. Traditional security mechanisms adopt a preventive approach, enforcing users to adhere to the prescribed policies. These systems are however too inflexible to be used in flexible processes where users often have to deal with unforeseen situations or emergencies (e.g., Health Care). In this contexts, it is crucial for organizations to assess the compliance of their systems to security policies to detect and react to security infringements. In this talk, I will give a short introduction on compliance checking techniques, discussing how they can be used to mitigate security risks for organization processes. In the end, I'll discuss some recent work we have done to infer patterns of anomalous behaviors from event logs.

                    From Descriptive Data to Actionable Alerts in Network Intrusion Detection Systems
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Many large-scale systems are not monolythic, but made of many subsystems that exchange messages over a network. To detect when something goes wrong, Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) usually monitor these messages, infer the state of the monitored system, and eventually raise alerts to the security operators. <br>
                    In this talk, I will give an overview on NIDS, and show two examples taken from my previous research: one of an Industrial Control System and one of a Building Automation System. <br>
                    I will use these examples to explain my view on how the design of a NIDS cannot happen "in a void"; instead, it is influenced by the information that can be extracted from the data sources, and by the information that needs to be conveyed by the alerts. <br>
                    I will conclude presenting a couple of future research directions that I believe can improve the design of NIDS.

                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Quantum error-correcting codes are an essential tool for the practical implementation of quantum computer and quantum communication. In 1996, Robert Calderbank, Peter Shor, and Andrew Steane invented a method to create quantum codes from classical codes, known as the CSS construction. This construction was generalized by Daniel Gottesman with the stabilizer formalism. In this talk, I will give a short introduction of quantum codes, from the definition of errors to the idea of stabilizer formalism. In the end, some current research interests will be shown, ending with some open problems.

                    DFA on AES with Byte External Encodings
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b> <br>
                    Several White-Box implementations of cryptographic algorithms suffer from side-channel inspired attacks like DFA or DCA. The strength of these attacks is that they can be applied automatically and require minimal reverse engineering effort. In order to mount these attacks, an adversary needs access to the input (DCA) or output (DCA or DFA) of the white-box implementation. Because of this, encoding the input and output of the white-box implementation via external encodings is considered an effective countermeasure against these types of attacks. We want to disprove this belief by presenting an efficient attack that, as DFA and DCA, can be applied in a fully automated way, but at the same time is able to cope with byte external encodings.

                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Machine learning has a long tradition of helping to solve complex information security problems that are difficult to solve manually. Deep Learning(DL) is a sub-field of machine learning, where models are composed of multiple layers of abstraction. In the past few years, there has been an enormous hype about DL, which has also spilled over to information security. <br>
                    In this talk, I want to shed some light on the hype and explore what is behind it (the talk will feature a Gartner hype cycle). First, I will sketch the core principles of DL, its place in the AI landscape and outline some of the compelling properties of DL algorithms. <br>
                    Then, I will give an overview of DL research in information security, which consists of two parts: DL applied to information security problems and security properties of DL algorithms. <br>
                    Finally, I want to highlight some misuses of DL algorithms in information security and want to outline some potential research directions.

                    Verified Multi-Precision Arithmetic for Cryptology in C++, at Run-Time and at Compile-Time (<a href="https://martindale.info/eipsi/ctbignum_slides_2018.pdf">slides</a>)
                </p><p>
                    <b>Abstract:</b>
                    Multi-precision arithmetic is arithmetic with operands whose size exceeds the machine word-size, on today's computers typically 64-bits.
                    In this talk, I will talk about the design of a library for multi-precision integer arithmetic for operands in the order of 100–500 bits. Many cryptographic schemes and applications, like elliptic-curve encryption schemes and secure multiparty computation frameworks require multi-precision arithmetic with integers whose bit-lengths lie in that range. <br>
                    The library is written in "optimizing-compiler-friendly" C++, with an emphasis on the use of fixed-size arrays and particular function-argument-passing styles (including the avoidance of naked pointers) to allow the limbs to be allocated on the stack or even in registers. Depending on the particular functionality, we get close to, or significantly beat the performance of existing libraries for multiprecision arithmetic that employ hand-optimized assembly code. <br>
                    Beyond the favorable runtime performance, our library is, to the best of the author's knowledge, the first library that offers big-integer computations during compile-time. For example, when implementing finite-field arithmetic with a fixed modulus, this feature enables the automatic precomputation (at compile time) of the special modulus-dependent constants required for Barrett and Montgomery reduction. Another application is to parse (at compile-time) a base-10-encoded big-integer literal. <br>
                    I will also talk about formal verification of correctness and of the constant-time property of some of the library's functions. I will discuss the "Software Analysis Workbench" (Galois Inc.), an open-source tool for proving equivalence between LLVM bitcode (compiled C of C++ code) and a specification in Cryptol, which is a high-level functional language targeted at describing cryptographic algorithms. Also, I will cover ct-verif (Almeida et al.), a tool for verifying that a particular function is constant-time. The takeaway here is that nowadays there exist mature and easy-to-use open-source tools for fully-automatic formal verification.
